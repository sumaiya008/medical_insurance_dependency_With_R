# medical_insurance_dependency_With_R

In this lab we explored the data using the dplyr
package and visualize it using the ggplot2 package for data
visualization. The data can be found in the companion package for this
course, statsr.

This Data set was selected from kaggle.com. This data set is useful
to researchers studying the dependency
between medical insurance cost
and consumers. I choose this data set to see is there anything that effects our medical insurance charges.

we did Statistical analysis (confidence intervals, central limit theorem, distribution modeling, hypothesis testing) using R pgramming language.
